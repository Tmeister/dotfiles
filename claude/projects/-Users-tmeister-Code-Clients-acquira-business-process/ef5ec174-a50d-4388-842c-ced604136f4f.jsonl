The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLooking at the conversation chronologically:\n\n1. The conversation started with a continuation from a previous session about HTML import functionality for RACI activities. The user requested unification of VersionCard components between SOP and Blueprint views.\n\n2. After successfully creating the unified VersionCard component, the user pointed out that the SOP version cards weren't showing the \"Set Status\" button like the Blueprint ones.\n\n3. I fixed this by enabling the status change functionality in SOP, but then the user requested alignment of the entire versioning flow between SOP and Blueprint:\n   - New core: \"Create SOP\" button → creates first version\n   - Existing versions: \"Save\" + \"Commit\" buttons\n   - Save: Override current version\n   - Commit: Create new version\n\n4. Multiple errors occurred during implementation:\n   - `setMainFormProcessing is not defined` - Fixed by adding state management\n   - Database error with 'draft' string instead of integer - Fixed backend to use integers\n   - Missing required fields (content_type, title) - Added required fields to requests\n   - Status update not working - Currently troubleshooting with comprehensive logging\n\n5. The user provided specific feedback throughout:\n   - \"No commit until I said so\" - I should wait for explicit permission\n   - \"Please review the related code slowly and take your time\" - I should check controller logic\n   - Status changes show success message but don't apply - Leading to current debugging effort\n\n6. Current state: Adding comprehensive logging to both frontend and backend to diagnose why status updates aren't persisting to the database despite showing success messages.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Initial: Create a unified VersionCard component for both SOP and Blueprint views to eliminate code duplication\n   - Add \"Set Status\" button functionality to SOP version cards matching Blueprint behavior\n   - Align SOP versioning flow exactly with Blueprint pattern:\n     1. No version: Show \"Create SOP\" button that creates first version via commit route\n     2. Existing version: Show \"Save\" (override current) + \"Commit\" (create new version) buttons\n   - Debug and fix status update functionality that shows success but doesn't persist changes\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Laravel 12 with PHP 8.2+ backend\n   - React 19 + TypeScript 5.7 frontend with Inertia.js\n   - Unified component architecture (VersionCard)\n   - Version control system with integer status values (0=Draft, 1=Current, 2=Future)\n   - Database transactions for atomic status updates\n   - Inertia.js data synchronization and state management\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `/resources/js/components/ui/version-card.tsx` (NEW)\n      - Created unified VersionCard component for reusability\n      - Supports both SOP and Blueprint navigation patterns\n      - Flexible props for status button and navigation\n      ```tsx\n      interface VersionCardProps {\n          version: any; // Using any to accommodate both ContentVersion and BlueprintVersion types\n          isCurrentVersion: boolean;\n          isViewingThisVersion: boolean;\n          getStatusBadge: (status: number) => React.JSX.Element;\n          href?: string;\n          SafeLink?: React.ComponentType<{ href: string; className?: string; children: React.ReactNode }>;\n          onStatusChange?: (version: any) => void;\n          showStatusButton?: boolean;\n      }\n      ```\n\n   - `/resources/js/pages/business-processes/cores/partials/sop-tab-content.tsx`\n      - Added status change handlers and button functionality\n      - Aligned versioning flow with Blueprint\n      - Added comprehensive logging for debugging\n      ```tsx\n      const handleStatusUpdate = () => {\n          if (!selectedVersionForStatus) return;\n          \n          const updateData = {\n              status: statusData.status,\n          };\n          \n          const routeUrl = route('business-processes.contents.versions.update-status', [core.process.id, core.id, content?.id, selectedVersionForStatus.id]);\n          \n          console.log('SOP handleStatusUpdate - Starting status update:', {\n              selectedVersion: selectedVersionForStatus,\n              updateData,\n              routeUrl,\n              routeParams: [core.process.id, core.id, content?.id, selectedVersionForStatus.id]\n          });\n          \n          router.put(routeUrl, updateData, {\n              preserveScroll: true,\n              preserveState: false, // Force data refresh to reflect status changes\n              onSuccess: (page) => {\n                  console.log('SOP handleStatusUpdate - Success response:', page);\n                  setShowStatusDialog(false);\n                  setSelectedVersionForStatus(null);\n                  resetStatusData();\n              },\n              onError: (errors) => {\n                  console.log('SOP handleStatusUpdate - Error response:', errors);\n                  toast.error('Failed to update status');\n              },\n              onFinish: () => {\n                  console.log('SOP handleStatusUpdate - Request finished');\n              },\n          });\n      };\n      ```\n\n   - `/app/Http/Controllers/CoreProcessController.php`\n      - Fixed status values from strings to integers\n      - Added comprehensive logging throughout updateVersionStatus method\n      - Fixed database transaction for atomic updates\n      ```php\n      public function updateVersionStatus(Request $request, BusinessProcessProcess $process, BusinessProcessCore $core, BusinessProcessContent $content, BusinessProcessContentVersion $version): RedirectResponse\n      {\n          Log::info('CoreProcessController::updateVersionStatus - Start', [\n              'request_data' => $request->all(),\n              'process_id' => $process->id,\n              'core_id' => $core->id,\n              'content_id' => $content->id,\n              'version_id' => $version->id,\n              'current_version_status' => $version->status,\n              'user_id' => Auth::id()\n          ]);\n          \n          // ... validation and transaction logic with integer status values\n      }\n      ```\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **ReferenceError: setMainFormProcessing is not defined**:\n     - Fixed by adding state management: `const [mainFormProcessing, setMainFormProcessing] = useState(false);`\n     - User feedback: Error occurred when clicking \"Create SOP\" button\n   \n   - **Database error: \"Incorrect integer value: 'draft' for column 'status'\"**:\n     - Fixed by changing backend from string status ('draft', 'current', 'archived') to integers (0, 1, 2)\n     - User feedback: \"Internal Server Error\" with detailed SQL error\n   \n   - **Missing required fields error**:\n     - Fixed by adding `content_type: 'sop'` and `title: mainFormData.title` to requests\n     - User feedback: \"No, content_type: The content type field is required. title: The title field is required.\"\n   \n   - **Status update not persisting**:\n     - Currently debugging with comprehensive logging\n     - User feedback: \"No, the set Status is not working... It reloads, show 2 confirmation toasts but the change is not applied\"\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Successfully unified VersionCard components eliminating duplication\n   - Aligned SOP versioning flow with Blueprint pattern\n   - Fixed multiple type mismatches and database errors\n   - Currently troubleshooting status update persistence issue with detailed logging\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"Are you sure is applied to the @resources/js/pages/business-processes/cores/partials/sop-tab-content.tsx I still see the old version card, this should show the \"Set Status\" as the blueprint one\"\n   - \"The versioning flow on the @resources/js/pages/business-processes/cores/partials/sop-tab-content.tsx should be exact as the @resources/js/pages/business-processes/blueprints/show.tsx\"\n   - \"[Request interrupted by user for tool use]No commit until I said so, and when I try the \"Create SOP\" button I got : 📎 Adding click handler to editor content sop-tab-content.tsx:190 Uncaught ReferenceError: setMainFormProcessing is not defined\"\n   - \"Internal Server Error Illuminate\\Database\\QueryException SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1366 Incorrect integer value: 'draft' for column 'status' at row 1\"\n   - \"No, content_type: The content type field is required. title: The title field is required.

Pending Tasks:\n   - Debug why status updates show success but don't persist to database\n   - Analyze logs from both frontend and backend to identify the issue\n   - Fix the status update persistence problem\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Added comprehensive logging to both frontend and backend to diagnose the status update issue:\n   - Frontend: Added console.log statements in handleStatusChange and handleStatusUpdate to track version selection, request data, and responses\n   - Backend: Added Log::info statements throughout updateVersionStatus to track request data, validation, transaction steps, and database updates\n   - The logging will help identify where the status update process is failing\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Once the user runs the status update again with logging enabled, analyze the console and Laravel logs to identify:\n   - Whether the correct data is being sent from frontend\n   - Whether the backend is receiving and processing the data correctly\n   - Whether the database transaction is completing successfully\n   - Whether Inertia is properly refreshing the data after update\n   \n   The user's most recent request was: \"No, the staus change is not been updated on the database or showed on the UI, I think we may want to add logs on both places\" - which I've just completed by adding comprehensive logging to both frontend and backend..\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."}]},"isCompactSummary":true,"uuid":"46fbba94-77c5-426a-9939-bd590fdd68f4","timestamp":"2025-06-23T19:37:45.213Z"}

Looking at the logs I added to both the frontend and backend, I need to check if there are any obvious issues.\n\nLooking at the SOP tab content (`sop-tab-content.tsx`), I can see:\n\n1. The frontend has comprehensive logging in `handleStatusUpdate` method (lines 320-353)\n2. It sends integer status values to the backend\n3. The route used is `business-processes.contents.versions.update-status`\n\nLooking at the CoreProcessController (`CoreProcessController.php`), I can see:\n\n1. The `updateVersionStatus` method has comprehensive logging (lines 565-651)\n2. It validates that status must be an integer in range 0,1,2 (line 589)\n3. It uses DB transactions to update the status\n4. It returns a success message\n\nThe issue could be several things:\n\n1. **Route mismatch**: The frontend is calling `business-processes.contents.versions.update-status` but maybe this route doesn't exist or points to the wrong controller method\n2. **Status type mismatch**: There could be a mismatch between how status is stored vs displayed\n3. **Data refresh issue**: The data might be updating but Inertia isn't refreshing properly\n4. **Transaction rollback**: The transaction might be failing silently\n\nLet me check what the actual issue might be by looking at the differences between the SOP and Blueprint implementations:\n\nIn Blueprint (`show.tsx`):\n- Line 126: `status: 'draft'` (string)\n- Line 266: `setStatusData('status', version.status.toString())` (converts to string)\n- Line 276: `status: statusData.status` (sends string)\n- Route: `business-processes.blueprints.versions.update-status`\n \nI notice critical discrepancies between the SOP and Blueprint implementations. The routes differ significantly, with Blueprint using a `blueprints` route while SOP uses a `contents` route. Moreover, the data type handling varies - Blueprint converts statuses to strings, whereas SOP maintains integer values. \n\nThe controller's `updateVersionStatus` method suggests strict integer validation, which could explain potential routing or type conversion challenges. These nuanced differences might be preventing successful status updates in the SOP implementation.\n\nThe route parameters seem structurally consistent: process_id, core_id, content_id, and version_id are present in both frontend and controller method signatures. This alignment indicates the routing mechanism itself appears sound.\n\nHowever, a critical inconsistency emerges in status handling. The controller oscillates between string and integer status representations. While the `updateVersionStatus` method explicitly validates integer statuses (0, 1, 2), the `storeContent` method initially uses a string status. This discrepancy could potentially trigger validation errors or unexpected behavior during version status updates.\n\nThe frontend's SOP is sending integer statuses, which matches the validation requirements. Yet the internal controller logic shows mixed status type usage, suggesting a potential source of confusion or potential bug in the status management workflow.\n\nMore intriguingly, the user reports receiving a success message alongside a 303 redirect status code - standard for Laravel POST/PUT requests. The core problem likely resides in the UI's data refresh mechanism. Potential root causes include Inertia data synchronization issues, database transaction complications, or caching mechanisms preventing real-time status reflection.\n\nThe frontend code attempts to force a data refresh with `preserveState: false`, theoretically ensuring status change visibility. However, this mechanism might be failing, preventing the updated status from rendering correctly in the user interface.\n\nThe most promising investigative approach involves examining comprehensive logs and comparing the backend data return against frontend data expectations. Specifically, the SOP tab's status update handler lacks explicit data refresh logic, which could explain the observed synchronization problem.\n\nI'll verify the route definition and data structure mapping, focusing on how `allVersions` and `viewingVersion` are constructed from potentially mismatched backend responses.

Looking at this more carefully, the issue is likely with the VersionCard component not properly displaying the updated status. Let me trace through the VersionCard component and how it receives and displays the status.\n\nLooking at the VersionCard component, it receives:\n1. `version` object with status\n2. `isCurrentVersion` boolean (checks if version.status === 1)\n3. `getStatusBadge` function that renders the badge based on status\n\nThe user is seeing the logs show that the database update is successful (status changes from 0 to 1), but the UI still shows \"WIP\" (which corresponds to status 0).\n\nLet me trace through:\n1. How the VersionCard gets its data\n2. How the status badge is rendered\n3. What the version status values should be\n\nFrom the SOP tab content, I can see:\n- `allVersions` comes from `content?.allVersions || versions || (content ? [content] : [])`\n- The version card gets `isCurrentVersion={version.status === 1}`\n- The status badge comes from `getStatusBadge(version.status)`\n\nThe issue could be:\n1. The `allVersions` data isn't being refreshed after the status update\n2. The `getStatusBadge` function isn't working correctly\n3. The version object isn't getting the updated status value\n\nLet me check the getStatusBadge function and VersionCard implementation.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":58403,"cache_read_input_tokens":13672,"output_tokens":5,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CQRj8ENAjmZQ22Tj3QeSA","uuid":"ab8fd0bc-1e08-42d0-aecc-bccefbd3b10c"}

So when this code runs:\n\n1. Version has status `1` (integer from database)\n2. Code looks for `$statusMap[1]` in `['draft' => 0, 'current' => 1, 'archived' => 2]`\n3. Key `1` doesn't exist, so it defaults to `0` (the `?? 0` fallback)\n4. All versions get status `0` (WIP) regardless of their actual database status\n\nThis is leftover code from when the status was stored as strings. Now that we store integers, this conversion is incorrect and breaks the status display.\n\nThe fix is to remove this conversion logic in the `showVersion` method, similar to how we fixed the main `show` method.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":13,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1333,"cache_read_input_tokens":79867,"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CQRjf2acSkKcf2oSVoqps","uuid":"90e63cda-05c4-44f4-ae8b-aa12548692a0"}

Now the fix is complete. Let me summarize what we found and fixed:\n\n## Summary of the Issue and Fix\n\n**Problem**: Version status was updating in the database but not displaying correctly in the UI when navigating to specific version pages.\n\n**Root Cause**: The `showVersion` method in `CoreProcessController` was trying to convert status values from strings to integers using a mapping like `['draft' => 0, 'current' => 1, 'archived' => 2]`. However, the database stores status as integers (0, 1, 2) directly. So when a version had status `1`, the code looked for `$statusMap[1]` which didn't exist, causing it to default to `0` (WIP).\n\n**Fix**: \n1. Updated the `showVersion` method to treat status as integers instead of trying to convert from strings\n2. Also improved the main `show` method to use fresh database queries instead of cached relationships\n3. Cleaned up all the debugging logs\n\nThe status update functionality should now work correctly on both:\n- Main core pages (`/business-processes/1/cores/1`)\n- Specific version pages (`/business-processes/1/cores/1/contents/8/versions/13`)","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":11,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2171,"cache_read_input_tokens":85636,"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CQRjkWigBbhAZtRgQaEbE","uuid":"aa196f85-1fd6-4a01-99e8-7d2c46010b6f"}

Control\n\n**Core Policies Pattern**\n```php\n// Example: SOPPolicy\nclass SOPPolicy\n{\n    public function viewAny(User $user): bool\n    public function view(User $user, SOP $sop): bool  \n    public function create(User $user): bool\n    public function update(User $user, SOP $sop): bool\n    public function delete(User $user, SOP $sop): bool\n}\n```\n\n**Key Policies**\n- **AssessmentPolicy** - Assessment access and progression rules\n- **AssessmentTemplatePolicy** - Admin-only template management\n- **ActivityPolicy** - Activity CRUD with owner validation\n- **DiagramPolicy** - Process diagram access control\n- **SOPPolicy** - SOP content management permissions\n\n### Role-Based System (Spatie Permission)\n```php\n// Roles hierarchy\nUser -> Admin -> Super Admin\n\n// Key permissions\n'view-admin-dashboard'\n'manage-assessment-templates'  \n'override-assessment-progress'\n'manage-users'\n'view-system-analytics'\n```\n\n## Form Request Validation\n\n### Assessment System Requests\n\n**StoreAssessmentRequest** (`app/Http/Requests/StoreAssessmentRequest.php`)\n```php\nclass StoreAssessmentRequest extends FormRequest\n{\n    public function rules(): array\n    {\n        return [\n            'assessment_template_id' => 'required|exists:assessment_templates,id',\n            'business_name' => 'required|string|max:255',\n            'naics_subsector_id' => 'required|exists:naics_subsectors,id',\n        ];\n    }\n    \n    public function authorize(): bool\n    {\n        return $this->user()->can('create-assessment');\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**AssessmentSubmissionRequest** (`app/Http/Requests/AssessmentSubmissionRequest.php`)\n- Dynamic validation based on question types\n- Conditional validation for dependent questions\n- File upload validation for supporting documents\n- Cross-field validation for consistency checks\n\n## Enums for Type Safety\n\n**AssessmentStatus** (`app/Enums/AssessmentStatus.php`)\n```php\nenum AssessmentStatus: string\n{\n    case DRAFT = 'draft';\n    case IN_PROGRESS = 'in_progress';  \n    case COMPLETED = 'completed';\n    case ARCHIVED = 'archived';\n}\n```\n\n**QuestionType** (`app/Enums/QuestionType.php`)\n```php\nenum QuestionType: string\n{\n    case MULTIPLE_CHOICE = 'multiple_choice';\n    case NUMBER = 'number';\n    case TEXT = 'text';\n    case TEXTAREA = 'textarea';\n    case EMAIL = 'email';\n    case SELECT = 'select';\n    case SELECT_DEPENDENT = 'select_dependent';\n}\n```\n\n## Middleware\n\n**AdminMiddleware** (`app/Http/Middleware/AdminMiddleware.php`)\n- Restricts access to admin routes\n- Integrates with Spatie permission system\n- Handles unauthorized access gracefully\n\n**FeatureMiddleware** (`app/Http/Middleware/FeatureMiddleware.php`)  \n- Feature flag enforcement\n- Controlled rollout of new features\n- A/B testing support\n\n**HandleInertiaRequests** (`app/Http/Middleware/HandleInertiaRequests.php`)\n- Global data sharing with frontend\n- User context and permissions\n- Flash message handling\n- Appearance theme persistence\n\n## Database Relationships\n\n### Complex Relationships\n\n**Polymorphic Content System**\n```php\n// BusinessProcessCore has polymorphic content\npublic function contents()\n{\n    return $this->hasMany(BusinessProcessContent::class, 'core_id');\n}\n\npublic function sopContent()\n{\n    return $this->contents()->where('type', 'sop')->latest()->first();\n}\n\npublic function visualContent()  \n{\n    return $this->contents()->where('type', 'visual')->latest()->first();\n}\n```\n\n**Assessment System Relationships**\n```php\n// User → UserAssessment → AssessmentTemplate → AssessmentQuestion\n// User → UserAssessmentProgress → AssessmentQuestion\n\nclass User extends Model\n{\n    public function assessments()\n    {\n        return $this->hasMany(UserAssessment::class);\n    }\n    \n    public function assessmentProgress()\n    {\n        return $this->hasMany(UserAssessmentProgress::class);\n    }\n    \n    public function completedAssessments()\n    {\n        return $this->assessments()->where('status', AssessmentStatus::COMPLETED);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Business Logic Patterns\n\n### Assessment Progression Logic\n```php\n// Progressive unlocking in AssessmentService\npublic function getNextAvailableAssessment(User $user): ?AssessmentTemplate\n{\n    $completed = $user->completedAssessments()->pluck('assessment_template_id');\n    \n    return AssessmentTemplate::active()\n        ->whereNotIn('id', $completed)\n        ->where('sequence', '>', $completed->count())\n        ->orderBy('sequence')\n        ->first();\n}\n```\n\n### RACI Matrix Management\n```php\n// Activity position management\npublic function updateActivityPositions(array $activities): void\n{\n    foreach ($activities as $index => $activityId) {\n        BusinessProcessActivity::where('id', $activityId)\n            ->update(['position' => $index + 1]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Content Versioning\n```php\n// Automatic version creation on content updates\npublic function updateContent(string $type, string $content, ?string $summary = null): void\n{\n    $contentRecord = $this->contents()->firstOrCreate(['type' => $type]);\n    \n    // Create new version\n    $contentRecord->versions()->create([\n        'content' => $content,\n        'summary' => $summary,\n        'version' => $contentRecord->versions()->count() + 1,\n        'created_by' => auth()->id(),\n    ]);\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Custom Exceptions\n```php\n// Assessment-specific exceptions\nclass AssessmentNotAccessibleException extends Exception {}\nclass AssessmentAlreadyCompletedException extends Exception {}\nclass InvalidAssessmentProgressException extends Exception {}\n\n// Process management exceptions  \nclass ProcessNotOwnedException extends Exception {}\nclass InvalidRaciDataException extends Exception {}\n```\n\n### Global Exception Handling\n- Inertia.js error pages for SPA experience\n- Validation error formatting for frontend\n- Admin notification for critical errors\n- User-friendly error messages\n\n## Artisan Commands\n\n**CheckUserProgress** (`app/Console/Commands/CheckUserProgress.php`)\n- Validates assessment progress integrity\n- Identifies and fixes orphaned progress records\n- Generates progress reports for analytics\n- Cleanup of incomplete assessments\n\n## Performance Optimizations\n\n### Query Optimization\n```php\n// Eager loading to prevent N+1 queries\npublic function index()\n{\n    return BusinessProcessCore::with([\n        'process.category',\n        'activities' => fn($q) => $q->orderBy('position'),\n        'contents.latestVersion'\n    ])->where('user_id', auth()->id())->get();\n}\n```\n\n### Caching Strategies\n```php\n// Assessment template caching\npublic function getActiveTemplates()\n{\n    return Cache::remember('assessment_templates.active', 3600, function () {\n        return AssessmentTemplate::active()->with('questions')->get();\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Considerations\n\n### Service Testing\n```php\n// Example service test\npublic function test_assessment_score_calculation()\n{\n    $assessment = UserAssessment::factory()->create();\n    $service = new AssessmentService();\n    \n    $scores = $service->calculateScore($assessment);\n    \n    $this->assertArrayHasKey('overall_score', $scores);\n    $this->assertIsFloat($scores['overall_score']);\n}\n```\n\n### Policy Testing\n```php\n// Authorization testing\npublic function test_user_can_only_view_own_assessments()\n{\n    $user = User::factory()->create();\n    $otherUser = User::factory()->create();\n    $assessment = UserAssessment::factory()->create(['user_id' => $otherUser->id]);\n    \n    $this->assertFalse($user->can('view', $assessment));\n}\n```\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Frontend Communication\n- **Inertia.js** for seamless SPA experience\n- **Shared props** for user context and permissions\n- **Flash messages** for user feedback\n- **Validation errors** passed to React components\n\n### External Services\n- **Resend** email service integration\n- **NAICS** industry classification system\n- **File storage** for assessment supporting documents\n\n## Security Implementation\n\n### Data Protection\n- **Mass assignment protection** with fillable/guarded\n- **SQL injection prevention** through Eloquent ORM\n- **XSS protection** via automatic escaping\n- **CSRF protection** on all forms\n\n### Access Control\n- **Policy-based authorization** for all resources\n- **User data isolation** - users only see their own data\n- **Admin role verification** for sensitive operations\n- **Feature flag protection** for new functionality\n\nThis backend architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for complex business process management and assessment workflows while maintaining security, performance, and maintainability standards.","numLines":514,"startLine":1,"totalLines":514}}}

Tailwind CSS Configuration\n\n**app.css** - Main stylesheet\n```css\n@import 'tailwindcss/base';\n@import 'tailwindcss/components';\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';\n\n/* Custom component styles */\n@layer components {\n  .rich-text-content {\n    @apply prose prose-sm max-w-none;\n  }\n  \n  .assessment-card {\n    @apply bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6;\n  }\n  \n  .process-activity-row {\n    @apply hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-150;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Custom utility classes */\n@layer utilities {\n  .text-balance {\n    text-wrap: balance;\n  }\n  \n  .scrollbar-thin {\n    scrollbar-width: thin;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Theme System\n\n**CSS Variables for Theming**\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: 0 0% 100%;\n  --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --card: 0 0% 100%;\n  --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n  --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  /* ... more theme variables */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  /* ... dark theme variables */\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Component Styling Patterns\n\n**Consistent Component Styling**\n```tsx\n// Using class-variance-authority for consistent styling\nconst buttonVariants = cva(\n  \"inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none ring-offset-background\",\n  {\n    variants: {\n      variant: {\n        default: \"bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90\",\n        destructive: \"bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90\",\n        outline: \"border border-input hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground\",\n        secondary: \"bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80\",\n        ghost: \"hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground\",\n        link: \"underline-offset-4 hover:underline text-primary\",\n      },\n      size: {\n        default: \"h-10 py-2 px-4\",\n        sm: \"h-9 px-3 rounded-md\",\n        lg: \"h-11 px-8 rounded-md\",\n        icon: \"h-10 w-10\",\n      },\n    },\n    defaultVariants: {\n      variant: \"default\",\n      size: \"default\",\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n## State Management\n\n### 1. Inertia.js State Management\n\n**Global State via Inertia Props**\n```tsx\n// Shared data available on all pages\ninterface SharedProps {\n  auth: {\n    user: User\n    permissions: string[]\n    roles: string[]\n  }\n  flash: {\n    success?: string\n    error?: string \n    info?: string\n  }\n  settings: {\n    appearance: AppearanceMode\n    features: FeatureFlag[]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Context Providers\n\n**SubsectorContext** (`contexts/subsector-context.tsx`)\n```tsx\ninterface SubsectorContextType {\n  sectors: NaicsSector[]\n  subsectors: NaicsSubsector[]\n  selectedSector: NaicsSector | null\n  selectedSubsector: NaicsSubsector | null\n  setSelectedSector: (sector: NaicsSector | null) => void\n  setSelectedSubsector: (subsector: NaicsSubsector | null) => void\n}\n\nexport const SubsectorContext = createContext<SubsectorContextType | undefined>(undefined)\n\nexport function useSubsector() {\n  const context = useContext(SubsectorContext)\n  if (!context) {\n    throw new Error('useSubsector must be used within SubsectorProvider')\n  }\n  return context\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### 1. Component Testing\n\n**Jest Configuration** (`jest.config.js`)\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',\n  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/resources/js/__tests__/setup.ts'],\n  moduleNameMapping: {\n    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/resources/js/$1',\n  },\n  collectCoverageFrom: [\n    'resources/js/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    '!resources/js/**/*.d.ts',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n**Component Test Example**\n```tsx\n// __tests__/components/ProcessActivitiesCard.test.tsx\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport ProcessActivitiesCard from '@/components/ProcessActivitiesCard'\n\ndescribe('ProcessActivitiesCard', () => {\n  const mockActivities = [\n    { id: '1', name: 'Activity 1', position: 1 },\n    { id: '2', name: 'Activity 2', position: 2 },\n  ]\n  \n  test('renders activities in correct order', () => {\n    render(<ProcessActivitiesCard activities={mockActivities} />)\n    \n    const activities = screen.getAllByTestId('activity-item')\n    expect(activities).toHaveLength(2)\n    expect(activities[0]).toHaveTextContent('Activity 1')\n  })\n  \n  test('handles drag and drop reordering', async () => {\n    const onReorder = jest.fn()\n    render(<ProcessActivitiesCard activities={mockActivities} onReorder={onReorder} />)\n    \n    // Simulate drag and drop\n    const firstActivity = screen.getByTestId('activity-1')\n    fireEvent.dragStart(firstActivity)\n    fireEvent.drop(screen.getByTestId('activity-2'))\n    \n    expect(onReorder).toHaveBeenCalledWith(['2', '1'])\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### 1. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading\n\n```tsx\n// Lazy load heavy components\nconst AssessmentResults = lazy(() => import('./pages/assessments/results'))\nconst RichTextEditor = lazy(() => import('./components/ui/rich-text-editor'))\n\n// Wrap in Suspense\n<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>\n  <AssessmentResults {...props} />\n</Suspense>\n```\n\n### 2. Memoization Strategies\n\n```tsx\n// Memoize expensive calculations\nconst assessmentProgress = useMemo(() => {\n  return calculateAssessmentProgress(assessment, questions)\n}, [assessment.data, questions])\n\n// Memoize component renders\nconst MemoizedQuestionRenderer = memo(QuestionRenderer, (prevProps, nextProps) => {\n  return prevProps.question.id === nextProps.question.id &&\n         prevProps.value === nextProps.value\n})\n```\n\n### 3. Virtual Scrolling for Large Lists\n\n```tsx\n// For large assessment question lists\nimport { VariableSizeList as List } from 'react-window'\n\nexport function VirtualizedQuestionList({ questions }: { questions: AssessmentQuestion[] }) {\n  const getItemSize = useCallback((index: number) => {\n    return questions[index].question_type === 'textarea' ? 200 : 100\n  }, [questions])\n  \n  return (\n    <List\n      height={600}\n      itemCount={questions.length}\n      itemSize={getItemSize}\n      itemData={questions}\n    >\n      {QuestionRow}\n    </List>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### 1. Error Boundaries\n\n```tsx\nclass AssessmentErrorBoundary extends Component<\n  { children: ReactNode },\n  { hasError: boolean; error?: Error }\n> {\n  constructor(props: { children: ReactNode }) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = { hasError: false }\n  }\n  \n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error) {\n    return { hasError: true, error }\n  }\n  \n  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {\n    console.error('Assessment error:', error, errorInfo)\n    // Report to error tracking service\n  }\n  \n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return <AssessmentErrorFallback error={this.state.error} />\n    }\n    \n    return this.props.children\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Form Validation\n\n```tsx\n// Client-side validation with Zod\nconst assessmentSchema = z.object({\n  business_name: z.string().min(1, 'Business name is required'),\n  naics_subsector_id: z.string().uuid('Please select an industry'),\n  responses: z.record(z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.array(z.string())]))\n})\n\nexport function useAssessmentValidation() {\n  const validateAssessment = useCallback((data: AssessmentFormData) => {\n    try {\n      assessmentSchema.parse(data)\n      return { isValid: true, errors: {} }\n    } catch (error) {\n      if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {\n        return {\n          isValid: false,\n          errors: error.flatten().fieldErrors\n        }\n      }\n      return { isValid: false, errors: { _form: 'Validation failed' } }\n    }\n  }, [])\n  \n  return { validateAssessment }\n}\n```\n\nThis frontend architecture provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for complex business process management and assessment workflows, emphasizing type safety, user experience, and performance optimization.","numLines":865,"startLine":1,"totalLines":865}}}

(`app/Services/AssessmentService.php`)\n```php\nclass AssessmentService\n{\n    // Core assessment logic\n    public function calculateScore(UserAssessment $assessment): array\n    public function getProgressSummary(User $user): array\n    public function canAccessAssessment(User $user, AssessmentTemplate $template): bool\n    public function generateReport(UserAssessment $assessment): array\n    \n    // Industry-specific calculations\n    public function applyNaicsAdjustments(array $scores, string $naicsCode): array\n    public function calculateBusinessValuation(array $scores, array $profile): float\n}\n```\n\n**ProgressTrackingService** (`app/Services/ProgressTrackingService.php`)\n```php\nclass ProgressTrackingService  \n{\n    // Progress management\n    public function updateProgress(UserAssessment $assessment, array $data): void\n    public function getCompletionPercentage(UserAssessment $assessment): float\n    public function getNextRequiredAssessment(User $user): ?AssessmentTemplate\n    \n    // Analytics and reporting\n    public function getProgressAnalytics(User $user): array\n    public function generateProgressReport(UserAssessment $assessment): array\n}\n```\n\n**ScoringService** (`app/Services/ScoringService.php`)\n```php\nclass ScoringService\n{\n    // Multi-dimensional scoring\n    public function calculateAssessmentScores(array $responses): array\n    public function applyWeightings(array $scores, AssessmentTemplate $template): array\n    public function generateTierRecommendations(array $scores): array\n    \n    //

(`app/Services/ValuationCalculator.php`)\n```php\nclass ValuationCalculator\n{\n    // Business valuation logic\n    public function calculateValuation(array $financials, array $qualitative): array\n    public function getMultiplierAdjustments(array $scores): float\n    public function generateValuationReport(array $data): array\n}\n```\n\n## Authorization System\n\n### Policy-Based Access Control\n\n**Core Policies Pattern**\n```php\n// Example: SOPPolicy\nclass SOPPolicy\n{\n    public function viewAny(User $user): bool\n    public function view(User $user, SOP $sop): bool  \n    public function create(User $user): bool\n    public function update(User $user, SOP $sop): bool\n    public function delete(User $user, SOP $sop): bool\n}\n```\n\n**Key Policies**\n- **AssessmentPolicy** - Assessment access and progression rules\n- **AssessmentTemplatePolicy** - Admin-only template management\n- **ActivityPolicy** - Activity CRUD with owner validation\n- **DiagramPolicy** - Process diagram access control\n- **SOPPolicy** - SOP content management permissions\n\n### Role-Based System (Spatie Permission)\n```php\n// Roles hierarchy\nUser -> Admin -> Super Admin\n\n// Key permissions\n'view-admin-dashboard'\n'manage-assessment-templates'  \n'override-assessment-progress'\n'manage-users'\n'view-system-analytics'\n```\n\n## Form Request Validation\n\n### Assessment System Requests\n\n**StoreAssessmentRequest** (`app/Http/Requests/StoreAssessmentRequest.php`)\n```php\nclass StoreAssessmentRequest extends FormRequest\n{\n    public function rules(): array\n    {\n        return [\n            'assessment_template_id' => 'required|exists:assessment_templates,id',\n            'business_name' => 'required|string|max:255',\n            'naics_subsector_id' => 'required|exists:naics_subsectors,id',\n        ];\n    }\n    \n    public function authorize(): bool\n    {\n        return $this->user()->can('create-assessment');\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**AssessmentSubmissionRequest** (`app/Http/Requests/AssessmentSubmissionRequest.php`)\n- Dynamic validation based on question types\n- Conditional validation for dependent questions\n- File upload validation for supporting documents\n- Cross-field validation for consistency checks\n\n## Enums for Type Safety\n\n**AssessmentStatus** (`app/Enums/AssessmentStatus.php`)\n```php\nenum AssessmentStatus: string\n{\n    case DRAFT = 'draft';\n    case IN_PROGRESS = 'in_progress';  \n    case COMPLETED = 'completed';\n    case ARCHIVED = 'archived';\n}\n```\n\n**QuestionType** (`app/Enums/QuestionType.php`)\n```php\nenum QuestionType: string\n{\n    case MULTIPLE_CHOICE = 'multiple_choice';\n    case NUMBER = 'number';\n    case TEXT = 'text';\n    case TEXTAREA = 'textarea';\n    case EMAIL = 'email';\n    case SELECT = 'select';\n    case SELECT_DEPENDENT = 'select_dependent';\n}\n```\n\n## Middleware\n\n**AdminMiddleware** (`app/Http/Middleware/AdminMiddleware.php`)\n- Restricts access to admin routes\n- Integrates with Spatie permission system\n- Handles unauthorized access gracefully\n\n**FeatureMiddleware** (`app/Http/Middleware/FeatureMiddleware.php`)  \n- Feature flag enforcement\n- Controlled rollout of new features\n- A/B testing support\n\n**HandleInertiaRequests** (`app/Http/Middleware/HandleInertiaRequests.php`)\n- Global data sharing with frontend\n- User context and permissions\n- Flash message handling\n- Appearance theme persistence\n\n## Database Relationships\n\n### Complex Relationships\n\n**Polymorphic Content System**\n```php\n// BusinessProcessCore has polymorphic content\npublic function contents()\n{\n    return $this->hasMany(BusinessProcessContent::class, 'core_id');\n}\n\npublic function sopContent()\n{\n    return $this->contents()->where('type', 'sop')->latest()->first();\n}\n\npublic function visualContent()  \n{\n    return $this->contents()->where('type', 'visual')->latest()->first();\n}\n```\n\n**Assessment System Relationships**\n```php\n// User → UserAssessment → AssessmentTemplate → AssessmentQuestion\n// User → UserAssessmentProgress → AssessmentQuestion\n\nclass User extends Model\n{\n    public function assessments()\n    {\n        return $this->hasMany(UserAssessment::class);\n    }\n    \n    public function assessmentProgress()\n    {\n        return $this->hasMany(UserAssessmentProgress::class);\n    }\n    \n    public function completedAssessments()\n    {\n        return $this->assessments()->where('status', AssessmentStatus::COMPLETED);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Business Logic Patterns\n\n### Assessment Progression Logic\n```php\n// Progressive unlocking in AssessmentService\npublic function getNextAvailableAssessment(User $user): ?AssessmentTemplate\n{\n    $completed = $user->completedAssessments()->pluck('assessment_template_id');\n    \n    return AssessmentTemplate::active()\n        ->whereNotIn('id', $completed)\n        ->where('sequence', '>', $completed->count())\n        ->orderBy('sequence')\n        ->first();\n}\n```\n\n### RACI Matrix Management\n```php\n// Activity position management\npublic function updateActivityPositions(array $activities): void\n{\n    foreach ($activities as $index => $activityId) {\n        BusinessProcessActivity::where('id', $activityId)\n            ->update(['position' => $index + 1]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Content Versioning\n```php\n// Automatic version creation on content updates\npublic function updateContent(string $type, string $content, ?string $summary = null): void\n{\n    $contentRecord = $this->contents()->firstOrCreate(['type' => $type]);\n    \n    // Create new version\n    $contentRecord->versions()->create([\n        'content' => $content,\n        'summary' => $summary,\n        'version' => $contentRecord->versions()->count() + 1,\n        'created_by' => auth()->id(),\n    ]);\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Custom Exceptions\n```php\n// Assessment-specific exceptions\nclass AssessmentNotAccessibleException extends Exception {}\nclass AssessmentAlreadyCompletedException extends Exception {}\nclass InvalidAssessmentProgressException extends Exception {}\n\n// Process management exceptions  \nclass ProcessNotOwnedException extends Exception {}\nclass InvalidRaciDataException extends Exception {}\n```\n\n### Global Exception Handling\n- Inertia.js error pages for SPA experience\n- Validation error formatting for frontend\n- Admin notification for critical errors\n- User-friendly error messages\n\n## Artisan Commands\n\n**CheckUserProgress** (`app/Console/Commands/CheckUserProgress.php`)\n- Validates assessment progress integrity\n- Identifies and fixes orphaned progress records\n- Generates progress reports for analytics\n- Cleanup of incomplete assessments\n\n## Performance Optimizations\n\n### Query Optimization\n```php\n// Eager loading to prevent N+1 queries\npublic function index()\n{\n    return BusinessProcessCore::with([\n        'process.category',\n        'activities' => fn($q) => $q->orderBy('position'),\n        'contents.latestVersion'\n    ])->where('user_id', auth()->id())->get();\n}\n```\n\n### Caching Strategies\n```php\n// Assessment template caching\npublic function getActiveTemplates()\n{\n    return Cache::remember('assessment_templates.active', 3600, function () {\n        return AssessmentTemplate::active()->with('questions')->get();\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Considerations\n\n### Service Testing\n```php\n// Example service test\npublic function test_assessment_score_calculation()\n{\n    $assessment = UserAssessment::factory()->create();\n    $service = new AssessmentService();\n    \n    $scores = $service->calculateScore($assessment);\n    \n    $this->assertArrayHasKey('overall_score', $scores);\n    $this->assertIsFloat($scores['overall_score']);\n}\n```\n\n### Policy Testing\n```php\n// Authorization testing\npublic function test_user_can_only_view_own_assessments()\n{\n    $user = User::factory()->create();\n    $otherUser = User::factory()->create();\n    $assessment = UserAssessment::factory()->create(['user_id' => $otherUser->id]);\n    \n    $this->assertFalse($user->can('view', $assessment));\n}\n```\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Frontend Communication\n- **Inertia.js** for seamless SPA experience\n- **Shared props** for user context and permissions\n- **Flash messages** for user feedback\n- **Validation errors** passed to React components\n\n### External Services\n- **Resend** email service integration\n- **NAICS** industry classification system\n- **File storage** for assessment supporting documents\n\n## Security Implementation\n\n### Data Protection\n- **Mass assignment protection** with fillable/guarded\n- **SQL injection prevention** through Eloquent ORM\n- **XSS protection** via automatic escaping\n- **CSRF protection** on all forms\n\n### Access Control\n- **Policy-based authorization** for all resources\n- **User data isolation** - users only see their own data\n- **Admin role verification** for sensitive operations\n- **Feature flag protection** for new functionality\n\nThis backend architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for complex business process management and assessment workflows while maintaining security, performance, and maintainability standards.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":96,"oldLines":10,"newStart":96,"newLines":12,"lines":[" - User-specific process filtering"," ","

(`app/Services/AssessmentService.php`)\n```php\nclass AssessmentService\n{\n    // Core assessment logic\n    public function calculateScore(UserAssessment $assessment): array\n    public function getProgressSummary(User $user): array\n    public function canAccessAssessment(User $user, AssessmentTemplate $template): bool\n    public function generateReport(UserAssessment $assessment): array\n    \n    // Industry-specific calculations\n    public function applyNaicsAdjustments(array $scores, string $naicsCode): array\n    public function calculateBusinessValuation(array $scores, array $profile): float\n}\n```\n\n**ProgressTrackingService** (`app/Services/ProgressTrackingService.php`)\n```php\nclass ProgressTrackingService  \n{\n    // Progress management\n    public function updateProgress(UserAssessment $assessment, array $data): void\n    public function getCompletionPercentage(UserAssessment $assessment): float\n    public function getNextRequiredAssessment(User $user): ?AssessmentTemplate\n    \n    // Analytics and reporting\n    public function getProgressAnalytics(User $user): array\n    public function generateProgressReport(UserAssessment $assessment): array\n}\n```\n\n**ScoringService** (`app/Services/ScoringService.php`)\n```php\nclass ScoringService\n{\n    // Multi-dimensional scoring\n    public function calculateAssessmentScores(array $responses): array\n    public function applyWeightings(array $scores, AssessmentTemplate $template): array\n    public function generateTierRecommendations(array $scores): array\n    \n    //

  public function getMultiplierAdjustments(array $scores): float\n    public function generateValuationReport(array $data): array\n}\n```\n\n## Authorization System\n\n### Policy-Based Access Control\n\n**Core Policies Pattern**\n```php\n// Example: SOPPolicy\nclass SOPPolicy\n{\n    public function viewAny(User $user): bool\n    public function view(User $user, SOP $sop): bool  \n    public function create(User $user): bool\n    public function update(User $user, SOP $sop): bool\n    public function delete(User $user, SOP $sop): bool\n}\n```\n\n**Key Policies**\n-

**DiagramPolicy** - Process diagram access control\n- **SOPPolicy** - SOP content management permissions\n\n### Role-Based System (Spatie Permission)\n```php\n// Roles hierarchy\nUser -> Admin -> Super Admin\n\n// Key permissions\n'view-admin-dashboard'\n'manage-assessment-templates'  \n'override-assessment-progress'\n'manage-users'\n'view-system-analytics'\n```\n\n## Form Request Validation\n\n### Assessment System Requests\n\n**StoreAssessmentRequest** (`app/Http/Requests/StoreAssessmentRequest.php`)\n```php\nclass StoreAssessmentRequest extends FormRequest\n{\n    public function rules(): array\n    {\n        return [\n            'assessment_template_id' => 'required|exists:assessment_templates,id',\n            'business_name' => 'required|string|max:255',\n            'naics_subsector_id' => 'required|exists:naics_subsectors,id',\n        ];\n    }\n    \n    public function authorize(): bool\n    {\n        return $this->user()->can('create-assessment');\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**AssessmentSubmissionRequest** (`app/Http/Requests/AssessmentSubmissionRequest.php`)\n- Dynamic validation based on question types\n- Conditional validation for dependent questions\n- File upload validation for supporting documents\n- Cross-field validation for consistency checks\n\n## Enums for Type Safety\n\n**AssessmentStatus** (`app/Enums/AssessmentStatus.php`)\n```php\nenum AssessmentStatus: string\n{\n    case DRAFT = 'draft';\n    case IN_PROGRESS = 'in_progress';  \n    case COMPLETED = 'completed';\n    case ARCHIVED = 'archived';\n}\n```\n\n**QuestionType** (`app/Enums/QuestionType.php`)\n```php\nenum QuestionType: string\n{\n    case MULTIPLE_CHOICE = 'multiple_choice';\n    case NUMBER = 'number';\n    case TEXT = 'text';\n    case TEXTAREA = 'textarea';\n    case EMAIL = 'email';\n    case SELECT = 'select';\n    case SELECT_DEPENDENT = 'select_dependent';\n}\n```\n\n## Middleware\n\n**AdminMiddleware** (`app/Http/Middleware/AdminMiddleware.php`)\n- Restricts access to admin routes\n- Integrates with Spatie permission system\n- Handles unauthorized access gracefully\n\n**FeatureMiddleware** (`app/Http/Middleware/FeatureMiddleware.php`)  \n- Feature flag enforcement\n- Controlled rollout of new features\n- A/B testing support\n\n**HandleInertiaRequests** (`app/Http/Middleware/HandleInertiaRequests.php`)\n- Global data sharing with frontend\n- User context and permissions\n- Flash message handling\n- Appearance theme persistence\n\n## Database Relationships\n\n### Complex Relationships\n\n**Polymorphic Content System**\n```php\n// BusinessProcessCore has polymorphic content\npublic function contents()\n{\n    return $this->hasMany(BusinessProcessContent::class, 'core_id');\n}\n\npublic function sopContent()\n{\n    return $this->contents()->where('type', 'sop')->latest()->first();\n}\n\npublic function visualContent()  \n{\n    return $this->contents()->where('type', 'visual')->latest()->first();\n}\n```\n\n**Assessment System Relationships**\n```php\n// User → UserAssessment → AssessmentTemplate → AssessmentQuestion\n// User → UserAssessmentProgress → AssessmentQuestion\n\nclass User extends Model\n{\n    public function assessments()\n    {\n        return $this->hasMany(UserAssessment::class);\n    }\n    \n    public function assessmentProgress()\n    {\n        return $this->hasMany(UserAssessmentProgress::class);\n    }\n    \n    public function completedAssessments()\n    {\n        return $this->assessments()->where('status', AssessmentStatus::COMPLETED);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Business Logic Patterns\n\n### Assessment Progression Logic\n```php\n// Progressive unlocking in AssessmentService\npublic function getNextAvailableAssessment(User $user): ?AssessmentTemplate\n{\n    $completed = $user->completedAssessments()->pluck('assessment_template_id');\n    \n    return AssessmentTemplate::active()\n        ->whereNotIn('id', $completed)\n        ->where('sequence', '>', $completed->count())\n        ->orderBy('sequence')\n        ->first();\n}\n```\n\n### RACI Matrix Management\n```php\n// Activity position management\npublic function updateActivityPositions(array $activities): void\n{\n    foreach ($activities as $index => $activityId) {\n        BusinessProcessActivity::where('id', $activityId)\n            ->update(['position' => $index + 1]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Content Versioning\n```php\n// Automatic version creation on content updates\npublic function updateContent(string $type, string $content, ?string $summary = null): void\n{\n    $contentRecord = $this->contents()->firstOrCreate(['type' => $type]);\n    \n    // Create new version\n    $contentRecord->versions()->create([\n        'content' => $content,\n        'summary' => $summary,\n        'version' => $contentRecord->versions()->count() + 1,\n        'created_by' => auth()->id(),\n    ]);\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Custom Exceptions\n```php\n// Assessment-specific exceptions\nclass AssessmentNotAccessibleException extends Exception {}\nclass AssessmentAlreadyCompletedException extends Exception {}\nclass InvalidAssessmentProgressException extends Exception {}\n\n// Process management exceptions  \nclass ProcessNotOwnedException extends Exception {}\nclass InvalidRaciDataException extends Exception {}\n```\n\n### Global Exception Handling\n- Inertia.js error pages for SPA experience\n- Validation error formatting for frontend\n- Admin notification for critical errors\n- User-friendly error messages\n\n## Artisan Commands\n\n**CheckUserProgress** (`app/Console/Commands/CheckUserProgress.php`)\n- Validates assessment progress integrity\n- Identifies and fixes orphaned progress records\n- Generates progress reports for analytics\n- Cleanup of incomplete assessments\n\n## Performance Optimizations\n\n### Query Optimization\n```php\n// Eager loading to prevent N+1 queries\npublic function index()\n{\n    return BusinessProcessCore::with([\n        'process.category',\n        'activities' => fn($q) => $q->orderBy('position'),\n        'contents.latestVersion'\n    ])->where('user_id', auth()->id())->get();\n}\n```\n\n### Caching Strategies\n```php\n// Assessment template caching\npublic function getActiveTemplates()\n{\n    return Cache::remember('assessment_templates.active', 3600, function () {\n        return AssessmentTemplate::active()->with('questions')->get();\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Considerations\n\n### Service Testing\n```php\n// Example service test\npublic function test_assessment_score_calculation()\n{\n    $assessment = UserAssessment::factory()->create();\n    $service = new AssessmentService();\n    \n    $scores = $service->calculateScore($assessment);\n    \n    $this->assertArrayHasKey('overall_score', $scores);\n    $this->assertIsFloat($scores['overall_score']);\n}\n```\n\n### Policy Testing\n```php\n// Authorization testing\npublic function test_user_can_only_view_own_assessments()\n{\n    $user = User::factory()->create();\n    $otherUser = User::factory()->create();\n    $assessment = UserAssessment::factory()->create(['user_id' => $otherUser->id]);\n    \n    $this->assertFalse($user->can('view', $assessment));\n}\n```\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Frontend Communication\n- **Inertia.js** for seamless SPA experience\n- **Shared props** for user context and permissions\n- **Flash messages** for user feedback\n- **Validation errors** passed to React components\n\n### External Services\n- **Resend** email service integration\n- **NAICS** industry classification system\n- **File storage** for assessment supporting documents\n\n## Security Implementation\n\n### Data Protection\n- **Mass assignment protection** with fillable/guarded\n- **SQL injection prevention** through Eloquent ORM\n- **XSS protection** via automatic escaping\n- **CSRF protection** on all forms\n\n### Access Control\n- **Policy-based authorization** for all resources\n- **User data isolation** - users only see their own data\n- **Admin role verification** for sensitive operations\n- **Feature flag protection** for new functionality\n\nThis backend architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for complex business process management and assessment workflows while maintaining security, performance, and maintainability standards.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":385,"oldLines":21,"newStart":385,"newLines":51,"lines":[" }"," ```"," ","-### Content Versioning","+### Content

Tailwind CSS Configuration\n\n**app.css** - Main stylesheet\n```css\n@import 'tailwindcss/base';\n@import 'tailwindcss/components';\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';\n\n/* Custom component styles */\n@layer components {\n  .rich-text-content {\n    @apply prose prose-sm max-w-none;\n  }\n  \n  .assessment-card {\n    @apply bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6;\n  }\n  \n  .process-activity-row {\n    @apply hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-150;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Custom utility classes */\n@layer utilities {\n  .text-balance {\n    text-wrap: balance;\n  }\n  \n  .scrollbar-thin {\n    scrollbar-width: thin;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Theme System\n\n**CSS Variables for Theming**\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: 0 0% 100%;\n  --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --card: 0 0% 100%;\n  --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n  --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  /* ... more theme variables */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  /* ... dark theme variables */\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Component Styling Patterns\n\n**Consistent Component Styling**\n```tsx\n// Using class-variance-authority for consistent styling\nconst buttonVariants = cva(\n  \"inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none ring-offset-background\",\n  {\n    variants: {\n      variant: {\n        default: \"bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90\",\n        destructive: \"bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90\",\n        outline: \"border border-input hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground\",\n        secondary: \"bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80\",\n        ghost: \"hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground\",\n        link: \"underline-offset-4 hover:underline text-primary\",\n      },\n      size: {\n        default: \"h-10 py-2 px-4\",\n        sm: \"h-9 px-3 rounded-md\",\n        lg: \"h-11 px-8 rounded-md\",\n        icon: \"h-10 w-10\",\n      },\n    },\n    defaultVariants: {\n      variant: \"default\",\n      size: \"default\",\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n## State Management\n\n### 1. Inertia.js State Management\n\n**Global State via Inertia Props**\n```tsx\n// Shared data available on all pages\ninterface SharedProps {\n  auth: {\n    user: User\n    permissions: string[]\n    roles: string[]\n  }\n  flash: {\n    success?: string\n    error?: string \n    info?: string\n  }\n  settings: {\n    appearance: AppearanceMode\n    features: FeatureFlag[]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Context Providers\n\n**SubsectorContext** (`contexts/subsector-context.tsx`)\n```tsx\ninterface SubsectorContextType {\n  sectors: NaicsSector[]\n  subsectors: NaicsSubsector[]\n  selectedSector: NaicsSector | null\n  selectedSubsector: NaicsSubsector | null\n  setSelectedSector: (sector: NaicsSector | null) => void\n  setSelectedSubsector: (subsector: NaicsSubsector | null) => void\n}\n\nexport const SubsectorContext = createContext<SubsectorContextType | undefined>(undefined)\n\nexport function useSubsector() {\n  const context = useContext(SubsectorContext)\n  if (!context) {\n    throw new Error('useSubsector must be used within SubsectorProvider')\n  }\n  return context\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### 1. Component Testing\n\n**Jest Configuration** (`jest.config.js`)\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',\n  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/resources/js/__tests__/setup.ts'],\n  moduleNameMapping: {\n    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/resources/js/$1',\n  },\n  collectCoverageFrom: [\n    'resources/js/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    '!resources/js/**/*.d.ts',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n**Component Test Example**\n```tsx\n// __tests__/components/ProcessActivitiesCard.test.tsx\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport ProcessActivitiesCard from '@/components/ProcessActivitiesCard'\n\ndescribe('ProcessActivitiesCard', () => {\n  const mockActivities = [\n    { id: '1', name: 'Activity 1', position: 1 },\n    { id: '2', name: 'Activity 2', position: 2 },\n  ]\n  \n  test('renders activities in correct order', () => {\n    render(<ProcessActivitiesCard activities={mockActivities} />)\n    \n    const activities = screen.getAllByTestId('activity-item')\n    expect(activities).toHaveLength(2)\n    expect(activities[0]).toHaveTextContent('Activity 1')\n  })\n  \n  test('handles drag and drop reordering', async () => {\n    const onReorder = jest.fn()\n    render(<ProcessActivitiesCard activities={mockActivities} onReorder={onReorder} />)\n    \n    // Simulate drag and drop\n    const firstActivity = screen.getByTestId('activity-1')\n    fireEvent.dragStart(firstActivity)\n    fireEvent.drop(screen.getByTestId('activity-2'))\n    \n    expect(onReorder).toHaveBeenCalledWith(['2', '1'])\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### 1. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading\n\n```tsx\n// Lazy load heavy components\nconst AssessmentResults = lazy(() => import('./pages/assessments/results'))\nconst RichTextEditor = lazy(() => import('./components/ui/rich-text-editor'))\n\n// Wrap in Suspense\n<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>\n  <AssessmentResults {...props} />\n</Suspense>\n```\n\n### 2. Memoization Strategies\n\n```tsx\n// Memoize expensive calculations\nconst assessmentProgress = useMemo(() => {\n  return calculateAssessmentProgress(assessment, questions)\n}, [assessment.data, questions])\n\n// Memoize component renders\nconst MemoizedQuestionRenderer = memo(QuestionRenderer, (prevProps, nextProps) => {\n  return prevProps.question.id === nextProps.question.id &&\n         prevProps.value === nextProps.value\n})\n```\n\n### 3. Virtual Scrolling for Large Lists\n\n```tsx\n// For large assessment question lists\nimport { VariableSizeList as List } from 'react-window'\n\nexport function VirtualizedQuestionList({ questions }: { questions: AssessmentQuestion[] }) {\n  const getItemSize = useCallback((index: number) => {\n    return questions[index].question_type === 'textarea' ? 200 : 100\n  }, [questions])\n  \n  return (\n    <List\n      height={600}\n      itemCount={questions.length}\n      itemSize={getItemSize}\n      itemData={questions}\n    >\n      {QuestionRow}\n    </List>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### 1. Error Boundaries\n\n```tsx\nclass AssessmentErrorBoundary extends Component<\n  { children: ReactNode },\n  { hasError: boolean; error?: Error }\n> {\n  constructor(props: { children: ReactNode }) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = { hasError: false }\n  }\n  \n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error) {\n    return { hasError: true, error }\n  }\n  \n  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {\n    console.error('Assessment error:', error, errorInfo)\n    // Report to error tracking service\n  }\n  \n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return <AssessmentErrorFallback error={this.state.error} />\n    }\n    \n    return this.props.children\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Form Validation\n\n```tsx\n// Client-side validation with Zod\nconst assessmentSchema = z.object({\n  business_name: z.string().min(1, 'Business name is required'),\n  naics_subsector_id: z.string().uuid('Please select an industry'),\n  responses: z.record(z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.array(z.string())]))\n})\n\nexport function useAssessmentValidation() {\n  const validateAssessment = useCallback((data: AssessmentFormData) => {\n    try {\n      assessmentSchema.parse(data)\n      return { isValid: true, errors: {} }\n    } catch (error) {\n      if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {\n        return {\n          isValid: false,\n          errors: error.flatten().fieldErrors\n        }\n      }\n      return { isValid: false, errors: { _form: 'Validation failed' } }\n    }\n  }, [])\n  \n  return { validateAssessment }\n}\n```\n\nThis frontend architecture provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for complex business process management and assessment workflows, emphasizing type safety, user experience, and performance optimization.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":197,"oldLines":7,"newStart":197,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," **Specialized UI Components**"," ```tsx","-// RichTextEditor - Universal content editor","+// RichTextEditor - Universal content editor (production-ready, no debug logs)"," interface RichTextEditorProps {","   value: string","   onChange: (value: string) => void"]},{"oldStart":206,"oldLines":6,"newStart":206,"newLines":29,"lines":["   readOnly?: boolean"," }"," ","+// Unified VersionCard - Reusable component for all content types","+interface VersionCardProps {","+  version: BaseVersion","+  isCurrentVersion: boolean","+  isViewingThisVersion: boolean","+  getStatusBadge: (status: number) => React.JSX.Element","+  href?: string","+  SafeLink?: React.ComponentType<{ href: string; className?: string; children: React.ReactNode }>","+  onStatusChange?: (version: BaseVersion) => void","+  showStatusButton?: boolean","+}","+","+// Enhanced BaseVersion interface for type safety","+interface BaseVersion {","+  id: string | number","+  version_number: string","+  status: number // 0=draft, 1=current, 2=future","+  change_summary: string","+  created_at: string","+  updated_at: string","+  creator?: User","+}","+"," // CodeEditor - For technical content"," interface CodeEditorProps {","   value: string"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

UI State Management\n\n**useAppearance** (`hooks/use-appearance.tsx`)\n```tsx\n// Theme management with persistence\nexport function useAppearance() {\n  const [appearance, setAppearance] = useState<'light' | 'dark' | 'system'>('system')\n  \n  const updateAppearance = useCallback((newAppearance: AppearanceMode) => {\n    setAppearance(newAppearance)\n    \n    // Persist to backend\n    router.patch('/settings/appearance', { appearance: newAppearance }, {\n      preserveState: true,\n    })\n    \n    // Update CSS class\n    updateThemeClass(newAppearance)\n  }, [])\n  \n  return { appearance, updateAppearance }\n}\n```\n\n## TypeScript Type System\n\n### 1. Core Business Types\n\n**Assessment Types** (`types/assessment.ts`)\n```tsx\nexport interface UserAssessment {\n  id: string\n  user_id: string\n  assessment_template_id: string\n  status: AssessmentStatus\n  data: AssessmentData\n  business_name: string\n  naics_subsector_id: string\n  started_at: string\n  completed_at?: string\n  created_at: string\n  updated_at: string\n}\n\nexport interface AssessmentQuestion {\n  id: string\n  assessment_template_id: string\n  question_text: string\n  question_type: QuestionType\n  options?: QuestionOption[]\n  validation_rules: ValidationRule[]\n  dependencies?: QuestionDependency[]\n  section: string\n  sequence: number\n  is_required: boolean\n  metadata?: Record<string, any>\n}\n\nexport type QuestionType = \n  | 'multiple_choice'\n  | 'number' \n  | 'text'\n  | 'textarea'\n  | 'email'\n  | 'select'\n  | 'select_dependent'\n\nexport interface AssessmentScores {\n  overall_score: number\n  section_scores: Record<string, number>\n  tier: BusinessTier\n  valuation_range: {\n    min: number\n    max: number\n  }\n  strengths: string[]\n  improvement_areas: string[]\n}\n```\n\n**Business Process Types** (`types/index.d.ts`)\n```tsx\nexport interface BusinessProcessCore {\n  id: string\n  process_id: string\n  user_id: string\n  name: string\n  description?: string\n  created_at: string\n  updated_at: string\n  process: BusinessProcess\n  activities: BusinessProcessActivity[]\n  contents: ProcessContent[]\n}\n\nexport interface BusinessProcessActivity {\n  id: string\n  core_id: string\n  name: string\n  description?: string\n  position: number\n  raci_data: RACIData\n  type?: string\n  created_at: string\n  updated_at: string\n}\n\nexport interface RACIData {\n  responsible: string[]\n  accountable: string[]\n  consulted: string[]\n  informed: string[]\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Form Types\n\n**Form State Management**\n```tsx\nexport interface FormErrors {\n  [key: string]: string | string[]\n}\n\nexport interface FormState<T> {\n  data: T\n  errors: FormErrors\n  processing: boolean\n  wasSuccessful: boolean\n  recentlySuccessful: boolean\n}\n\n// Generic form hook type\nexport interface UseFormReturn<T> extends FormState<T> {\n  setData: (data: Partial<T> | ((prev: T) => T)) => void\n  post: (url: string, options?: RequestOptions) => void\n  patch: (url: string, options?: RequestOptions) => void\n  reset: (...fields: (keyof T)[]) => void\n  clearErrors: (...fields: (keyof T)[]) => void\n}\n```\n\n## Styling Architecture\n\n### 1. Tailwind CSS Configuration\n\n**app.css** - Main stylesheet\n```css\n@import 'tailwindcss/base';\n@import 'tailwindcss/components';\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';\n\n/* Custom component styles */\n@layer components {\n  .rich-text-content {\n    @apply prose prose-sm max-w-none;\n  }\n  \n  .assessment-card {\n    @apply bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6;\n  }\n  \n  .process-activity-row {\n    @apply hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-150;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Custom utility classes */\n@layer utilities {\n  .text-balance {\n    text-wrap: balance;\n  }\n  \n  .scrollbar-thin {\n    scrollbar-width: thin;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Theme System\n\n**CSS Variables for Theming**\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: 0 0% 100%;\n  --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --card: 0 0% 100%;\n  --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n  --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  /* ... more theme variables */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  /* ... dark theme variables */\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Component Styling Patterns\n\n**Consistent Component Styling**\n```tsx\n// Using class-variance-authority for consistent styling\nconst buttonVariants = cva(\n  \"inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none ring-offset-background\",\n  {\n    variants: {\n      variant: {\n        default: \"bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90\",\n        destructive: \"bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90\",\n        outline: \"border border-input hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground\",\n        secondary: \"bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80\",\n        ghost: \"hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground\",\n        link: \"underline-offset-4 hover:underline text-primary\",\n      },\n      size: {\n        default: \"h-10 py-2 px-4\",\n        sm: \"h-9 px-3 rounded-md\",\n        lg: \"h-11 px-8 rounded-md\",\n        icon: \"h-10 w-10\",\n      },\n    },\n    defaultVariants: {\n      variant: \"default\",\n      size: \"default\",\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n## State Management\n\n### 1. Inertia.js State Management\n\n**Global State via Inertia Props**\n```tsx\n// Shared data available on all pages\ninterface SharedProps {\n  auth: {\n    user: User\n    permissions: string[]\n    roles: string[]\n  }\n  flash: {\n    success?: string\n    error?: string \n    info?: string\n  }\n  settings: {\n    appearance: AppearanceMode\n    features: FeatureFlag[]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Context Providers\n\n**SubsectorContext** (`contexts/subsector-context.tsx`)\n```tsx\ninterface SubsectorContextType {\n  sectors: NaicsSector[]\n  subsectors: NaicsSubsector[]\n  selectedSector: NaicsSector | null\n  selectedSubsector: NaicsSubsector | null\n  setSelectedSector: (sector: NaicsSector | null) => void\n  setSelectedSubsector: (subsector: NaicsSubsector | null) => void\n}\n\nexport const SubsectorContext = createContext<SubsectorContextType | undefined>(undefined)\n\nexport function useSubsector() {\n  const context = useContext(SubsectorContext)\n  if (!context) {\n    throw new Error('useSubsector must be used within SubsectorProvider')\n  }\n  return context\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### 1. Component Testing\n\n**Jest Configuration** (`jest.config.js`)\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',\n  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/resources/js/__tests__/setup.ts'],\n  moduleNameMapping: {\n    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/resources/js/$1',\n  },\n  collectCoverageFrom: [\n    'resources/js/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    '!resources/js/**/*.d.ts',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n**Component Test Example**\n```tsx\n// __tests__/components/ProcessActivitiesCard.test.tsx\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport ProcessActivitiesCard from '@/components/ProcessActivitiesCard'\n\ndescribe('ProcessActivitiesCard', () => {\n  const mockActivities = [\n    { id: '1', name: 'Activity 1', position: 1 },\n    { id: '2', name: 'Activity 2', position: 2 },\n  ]\n  \n  test('renders activities in correct order', () => {\n    render(<ProcessActivitiesCard activities={mockActivities} />)\n    \n    const activities = screen.getAllByTestId('activity-item')\n    expect(activities).toHaveLength(2)\n    expect(activities[0]).toHaveTextContent('Activity 1')\n  })\n  \n  test('handles drag and drop reordering', async () => {\n    const onReorder = jest.fn()\n    render(<ProcessActivitiesCard activities={mockActivities} onReorder={onReorder} />)\n    \n    // Simulate drag and drop\n    const firstActivity = screen.getByTestId('activity-1')\n    fireEvent.dragStart(firstActivity)\n    fireEvent.drop(screen.getByTestId('activity-2'))\n    \n    expect(onReorder).toHaveBeenCalledWith(['2', '1'])\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### 1. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading\n\n```tsx\n// Lazy load heavy components\nconst AssessmentResults = lazy(() => import('./pages/assessments/results'))\nconst RichTextEditor = lazy(() => import('./components/ui/rich-text-editor'))\n\n// Wrap in Suspense\n<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>\n  <AssessmentResults {...props} />\n</Suspense>\n```\n\n### 2. Memoization Strategies\n\n```tsx\n// Memoize expensive calculations\nconst assessmentProgress = useMemo(() => {\n  return calculateAssessmentProgress(assessment, questions)\n}, [assessment.data, questions])\n\n// Memoize component renders\nconst MemoizedQuestionRenderer = memo(QuestionRenderer, (prevProps, nextProps) => {\n  return prevProps.question.id === nextProps.question.id &&\n         prevProps.value === nextProps.value\n})\n```\n\n### 3. Virtual Scrolling for Large Lists\n\n```tsx\n// For large assessment question lists\nimport { VariableSizeList as List } from 'react-window'\n\nexport function VirtualizedQuestionList({ questions }: { questions: AssessmentQuestion[] }) {\n  const getItemSize = useCallback((index: number) => {\n    return questions[index].question_type === 'textarea' ? 200 : 100\n  }, [questions])\n  \n  return (\n    <List\n      height={600}\n      itemCount={questions.length}\n      itemSize={getItemSize}\n      itemData={questions}\n    >\n      {QuestionRow}\n    </List>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### 1. Error Boundaries\n\n```tsx\nclass AssessmentErrorBoundary extends Component<\n  { children: ReactNode },\n  { hasError: boolean; error?: Error }\n> {\n  constructor(props: { children: ReactNode }) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = { hasError: false }\n  }\n  \n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error) {\n    return { hasError: true, error }\n  }\n  \n  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {\n    console.error('Assessment error:', error, errorInfo)\n    // Report to error tracking service\n  }\n  \n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return <AssessmentErrorFallback error={this.state.error} />\n    }\n    \n    return this.props.children\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Form Validation\n\n```tsx\n// Client-side validation with Zod\nconst assessmentSchema = z.object({\n  business_name: z.string().min(1, 'Business name is required'),\n  naics_subsector_id: z.string().uuid('Please select an industry'),\n  responses: z.record(z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.array(z.string())]))\n})\n\nexport function useAssessmentValidation() {\n  const validateAssessment = useCallback((data: AssessmentFormData) => {\n    try {\n      assessmentSchema.parse(data)\n      return { isValid: true, errors: {} }\n    } catch (error) {\n      if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {\n        return {\n          isValid: false,\n          errors: error.flatten().fieldErrors\n        }\n      }\n      return { isValid: false, errors: { _form: 'Validation failed' } }\n    }\n  }, [])\n  \n  return { validateAssessment }\n}\n```\n\nThis frontend architecture provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for complex business process management and assessment workflows, emphasizing type safety, user experience, and performance optimization.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":310,"oldLines":6,"newStart":310,"newLines":66,"lines":[" "," ### 3.

Tailwind CSS Configuration\n\n**app.css** - Main stylesheet\n```css\n@import 'tailwindcss/base';\n@import 'tailwindcss/components';\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';\n\n/* Custom component styles */\n@layer components {\n  .rich-text-content {\n    @apply prose prose-sm max-w-none;\n  }\n  \n  .assessment-card {\n    @apply bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6;\n  }\n  \n  .process-activity-row {\n    @apply hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-150;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Custom utility classes */\n@layer utilities {\n  .text-balance {\n    text-wrap: balance;\n  }\n  \n  .scrollbar-thin {\n    scrollbar-width: thin;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Theme System\n\n**CSS Variables for Theming**\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: 0 0% 100%;\n  --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --card: 0 0% 100%;\n  --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n  --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  /* ... more theme variables */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n  --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n  /* ... dark theme variables */\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Component Styling Patterns\n\n**Consistent Component Styling**\n```tsx\n// Using class-variance-authority for consistent styling\nconst buttonVariants = cva(\n  \"inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none ring-offset-background\",\n  {\n    variants: {\n      variant: {\n        default: \"bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90\",\n        destructive: \"bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90\",\n        outline: \"border border-input hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground\",\n        secondary: \"bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80\",\n        ghost: \"hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground\",\n        link: \"underline-offset-4 hover:underline text-primary\",\n      },\n      size: {\n        default: \"h-10 py-2 px-4\",\n        sm: \"h-9 px-3 rounded-md\",\n        lg: \"h-11 px-8 rounded-md\",\n        icon: \"h-10 w-10\",\n      },\n    },\n    defaultVariants: {\n      variant: \"default\",\n      size: \"default\",\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n## State Management\n\n### 1. Inertia.js State Management\n\n**Global State via Inertia Props**\n```tsx\n// Shared data available on all pages\ninterface SharedProps {\n  auth: {\n    user: User\n    permissions: string[]\n    roles: string[]\n  }\n  flash: {\n    success?: string\n    error?: string \n    info?: string\n  }\n  settings: {\n    appearance: AppearanceMode\n    features: FeatureFlag[]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Context Providers\n\n**SubsectorContext** (`contexts/subsector-context.tsx`)\n```tsx\ninterface SubsectorContextType {\n  sectors: NaicsSector[]\n  subsectors: NaicsSubsector[]\n  selectedSector: NaicsSector | null\n  selectedSubsector: NaicsSubsector | null\n  setSelectedSector: (sector: NaicsSector | null) => void\n  setSelectedSubsector: (subsector: NaicsSubsector | null) => void\n}\n\nexport const SubsectorContext = createContext<SubsectorContextType | undefined>(undefined)\n\nexport function useSubsector() {\n  const context = useContext(SubsectorContext)\n  if (!context) {\n    throw new Error('useSubsector must be used within SubsectorProvider')\n  }\n  return context\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### 1. Component Testing\n\n**Jest Configuration** (`jest.config.js`)\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',\n  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/resources/js/__tests__/setup.ts'],\n  moduleNameMapping: {\n    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/resources/js/$1',\n  },\n  collectCoverageFrom: [\n    'resources/js/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    '!resources/js/**/*.d.ts',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n**Component Test Example**\n```tsx\n// __tests__/components/ProcessActivitiesCard.test.tsx\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport ProcessActivitiesCard from '@/components/ProcessActivitiesCard'\n\ndescribe('ProcessActivitiesCard', () => {\n  const mockActivities = [\n    { id: '1', name: 'Activity 1', position: 1 },\n    { id: '2', name: 'Activity 2', position: 2 },\n  ]\n  \n  test('renders activities in correct order', () => {\n    render(<ProcessActivitiesCard activities={mockActivities} />)\n    \n    const activities = screen.getAllByTestId('activity-item')\n    expect(activities).toHaveLength(2)\n    expect(activities[0]).toHaveTextContent('Activity 1')\n  })\n  \n  test('handles drag and drop reordering', async () => {\n    const onReorder = jest.fn()\n    render(<ProcessActivitiesCard activities={mockActivities} onReorder={onReorder} />)\n    \n    // Simulate drag and drop\n    const firstActivity = screen.getByTestId('activity-1')\n    fireEvent.dragStart(firstActivity)\n    fireEvent.drop(screen.getByTestId('activity-2'))\n    \n    expect(onReorder).toHaveBeenCalledWith(['2', '1'])\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### 1. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading\n\n```tsx\n// Lazy load heavy components\nconst AssessmentResults = lazy(() => import('./pages/assessments/results'))\nconst RichTextEditor = lazy(() => import('./components/ui/rich-text-editor'))\n\n// Wrap in Suspense\n<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>\n  <AssessmentResults {...props} />\n</Suspense>\n```\n\n### 2. Memoization Strategies\n\n```tsx\n// Memoize expensive calculations\nconst assessmentProgress = useMemo(() => {\n  return calculateAssessmentProgress(assessment, questions)\n}, [assessment.data, questions])\n\n// Memoize component renders\nconst MemoizedQuestionRenderer = memo(QuestionRenderer, (prevProps, nextProps) => {\n  return prevProps.question.id === nextProps.question.id &&\n         prevProps.value === nextProps.value\n})\n```\n\n### 3. Virtual Scrolling for Large Lists\n\n```tsx\n// For large assessment question lists\nimport { VariableSizeList as List } from 'react-window'\n\nexport function VirtualizedQuestionList({ questions }: { questions: AssessmentQuestion[] }) {\n  const getItemSize = useCallback((index: number) => {\n    return questions[index].question_type === 'textarea' ? 200 : 100\n  }, [questions])\n  \n  return (\n    <List\n      height={600}\n      itemCount={questions.length}\n      itemSize={getItemSize}\n      itemData={questions}\n    >\n      {QuestionRow}\n    </List>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### 1. Error Boundaries\n\n```tsx\nclass AssessmentErrorBoundary extends Component<\n  { children: ReactNode },\n  { hasError: boolean; error?: Error }\n> {\n  constructor(props: { children: ReactNode }) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = { hasError: false }\n  }\n  \n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error) {\n    return { hasError: true, error }\n  }\n  \n  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {\n    console.error('Assessment error:', error, errorInfo)\n    // Report to error tracking service\n  }\n  \n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return <AssessmentErrorFallback error={this.state.error} />\n    }\n    \n    return this.props.children\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Form Validation\n\n```tsx\n// Client-side validation with Zod\nconst assessmentSchema = z.object({\n  business_name: z.string().min(1, 'Business name is required'),\n  naics_subsector_id: z.string().uuid('Please select an industry'),\n  responses: z.record(z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.array(z.string())]))\n})\n\nexport function useAssessmentValidation() {\n  const validateAssessment = useCallback((data: AssessmentFormData) => {\n    try {\n      assessmentSchema.parse(data)\n      return { isValid: true, errors: {} }\n    } catch (error) {\n      if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {\n        return {\n          isValid: false,\n          errors: error.flatten().fieldErrors\n        }\n      }\n      return { isValid: false, errors: { _form: 'Validation failed' } }\n    }\n  }, [])\n  \n  return { validateAssessment }\n}\n```\n\nThis frontend architecture provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for complex business process management and assessment workflows, emphasizing type safety, user experience, and performance optimization.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":575,"oldLines":6,"newStart":575,"newLines":35,"lines":[" "," **Business Process Types** (`types/index.d.ts`)"," ```tsx","+// Enhanced BaseVersion interface for unified version management","+export interface BaseVersion {","+  id: string | number","+  version_number: string","+  status: number // 0=draft, 1=current, 2=future (integer-based)","+  change_summary: string","+  created_at: string","+  updated_at: string","+  creator?: User","+  version_label?: string // Computed property for display","+}","+","+// Content-specific version interfaces extending BaseVersion","+export interface ContentVersion extends BaseVersion {","+  content_id: string | number","+  content: string","+  metadata: Record<string, any>","+  created_by: string | number","+  updated_by: string | number","+}","+","+export interface BlueprintVersion extends BaseVersion {","+  activity_id: string | number","+  content: string","+  metadata: Record<string, any>","+  created_by: string | number","+  updated_by: string | number","+}","+"," export interface BusinessProcessCore {","   id: string","   process_id: string"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

`responsible?: string` (main executor)\n  - `accountable?: string` (final approver) \n  - `consulted?: string` (advisors)\n  - `informed?: string` (notified parties)\n  - `name: string` (activity name)\n  - `position: number` (sequence order)\n\n### Current Implementation\n- Swimlane tab currently shows placeholder content\n- RACI tab has full activity management via `BusinessProcessActivitiesCard`\n- Data flows through `core.activities` from the backend\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Data Processing & Lane Generation\n1. **Extract unique roles** from all RACI fields across activities\n2. **Create role-based lanes** (each unique person becomes a swimlane)\n3. **Map activities to primary lanes** based on \"Responsible\" field\n4. **Generate activity flow sequence** using position field\n\n### Phase 2: Swimlane Chart Component\nCreate new component: `SwimlaneChart.tsx`\n\n**Features:**\n- **Horizontal lanes** for each role (like Tiago, Dale, Julia, etc.)\n- **Activity boxes** with color coding based on role assignment\n- **Flow connectors** showing process sequence\n- **Responsive design** with horizontal scrolling for long processes\n- **Interactive tooltips** showing full RACI details\n- **Legend** explaining color coding and role assignments\n\n### Phase 3: Integration\n1. **Update SwimlaneTabContent** to use the new chart component\n2. **Add data fetching** if additional activity details needed\n3. **Handle empty states** when no activities exist\n4. **Add error boundaries** for robust chart rendering\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n\n### Data Structure\n```typescript\ninterface SwimlaneData {\n  lanes: SwimlaneLane[]\n  activities: SwimlaneActivity[]\n  connections: ActivityConnection[]\n}\n\ninterface SwimlaneLane {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  role: 'responsible' | 'accountable' | 'consulted' | 'informed'\n  color: string\n}\n\ninterface SwimlaneActivity {\n  id: number\n  name: string\n  laneId: string\n  position: number\n  raciRoles: {\n    responsible?: string[]\n    accountable?: string[]\n    consulted?: string[]\n    informed?: string[]\n  }\n  color: string\n  width: number\n}\n```\n\n### Visual Design\n- **Color coding** matching the example:\n  - Blue for Tiago (Content Lead)\n  - Orange for Dale (Delivery Manager) \n  - Green for Julia (VIP Operations)\n  - Purple for Mick (Onboarding)\n  - Red for Kike (Tech Systems)\n  - Gray for Coach (Implementation)\n- **Activity boxes** with rounded corners and proper spacing\n- **Flow arrows** connecting sequential activities\n- **Responsive grid layout** with proper lane alignment\n\n### Chart Rendering\n- **SVG-based implementation** for crisp lines and scalability\n- **Canvas fallback** for complex interactions if needed\n- **Zoom and pan functionality** for large process flows\n- **Export capabilities** (PNG/PDF) for documentation\n\n### User Interactions\n- **Click activities** to view RACI details\n- **Hover effects** for additional information\n- **Edit mode integration** with existing activity management\n- **Filter by role** to highlight specific lanes\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n### New Files\n- `resources/js/components/charts/swimlane-chart.tsx`\n- `resources/js/components/charts/swimlane-activity.tsx` \n- `resources/js/components/charts/swimlane-lane.tsx`\n- `resources/js/utils/swimlane-data-processor.ts`\n\n### Modified Files\n- `resources/js/pages/business-processes/cores/partials/swimlane-tab-content.tsx`\n- `resources/js/pages/business-processes/cores/show.tsx` (add activities prop)\n- `resources/js/types/index.d.ts` (add swimlane types)\n\n## Dependencies\n- **Existing**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons\n- **New**: May need D3.js for advanced chart features or stick with pure React/SVG\n- **Chart libraries**: Consider Recharts integration for consistency\n\n## Benefits\n1. **Visual process mapping** - Clear cross-functional flow visualization\n2. **RACI transparency** - Easy identification of roles and responsibilities  \n3. **Process optimization** - Visual bottlenecks and handoff points\n4. **Team alignment** - Clear understanding of who does what when\n5. **Documentation** - Professional process diagrams for stakeholders\n\nThis implementation will transform the placeholder swimlane tab into a powerful process visualization tool that leverages existing RACI data to create meaningful cross-functional process flow diagrams."}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":917,"cache_read_input_tokens":114795,"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CQRp2PWFWVGJM5xorLWaQ","type":"assistant","uuid":"60feb673-af2f-4e0b-86f6-a413d48355b4","timestamp":"2025-06-23T20:49:52.623Z"}
