# My Universal Coding Preferences

## All Languages

- Early returns over nested conditions
- Explicit types when available
- Descriptive names over comments
- Consistent formatting within project
- Test alongside implementation
- No comments explaining what, only why
- strict types when possible

## API Development

- RESTful conventions
- API responses always paginated
- UTC timestamps everywhere
- Consistent error format
- Version in URL (/api/v1)

## General Patterns

- Functional over class-based
- Composition over inheritance
- Small, focused functions
- Meaningful git commits
- Environment variables for config
