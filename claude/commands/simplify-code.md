# Code Simplification Command

Refactor complex code to be more readable, maintainable, and easier to understand while preserving functionality and improving overall code quality.

## Instructions

Simplify and refactor complex code for better readability: **$ARGUMENTS**

**Flags:**
- `--scope <scope>`: Simplification scope - `function`, `class`, `file` (default), `module`
- `--strategy <strategy>`: Focus strategy - `extract-methods`, `reduce-complexity`, `improve-naming`, `all` (default)
- `--preserve-performance`: Ensure performance characteristics are maintained
- `--include-tests`: Update and simplify related test code
- `--dry-run`: Show proposed changes without applying them
- `--complexity-threshold <number>`: Target maximum cyclomatic complexity (default: 10)

1. **Code Complexity Analysis**
   ```markdown
   ## Complexity Assessment

   ### Current Complexity Metrics
   - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: ${CURRENT_COMPLEXITY}
   - **Cognitive Complexity**: ${COGNITIVE_COMPLEXITY}
   - **Lines of Code**: ${LOC}
   - **Nested Levels**: ${NESTING_DEPTH}
   - **Function Length**: ${FUNCTION_LENGTH}

   ### Complexity Hotspots Identified
   - **Deep Nesting**: Functions with more than 3 levels of indentation
   - **Long Functions**: Functions exceeding 50 lines
   - **Complex Conditionals**: Multiple AND/OR operations in single condition
   - **Nested Loops**: Loops within loops within loops
   - **Large Classes**: Classes with excessive responsibilities

   ### Maintainability Impact
   - **Bug Risk**: Higher complexity correlates with increased bug likelihood
   - **Development Speed**: Complex code slows down feature development
   - **Testing Difficulty**: Complex logic is harder to test comprehensively
   - **Knowledge Transfer**: New team members struggle with complex code
   ```

2. **Simplification Strategy Selection**
   ```markdown

   - Code blocks with clear single responsibilities
   - Repeated code patterns
   - Complex calculations or business logic

   #### Benefits
   - Improved readability through descriptive method names
   - Enhanced testability of individual components
   - Reduced duplication through method reuse
   - Better separation of concerns

   ### Reduce Complexity Strategy
   #### When to Apply
   - Cyclomatic complexity greater than 10
   - Deep nesting levels (more than 3-4 levels)
   - Complex conditional expressions
   - Multiple responsibilities in single function

   #### Techniques
   - Early return patterns to reduce nesting
   - Guard clauses for input validation
   - Strategy pattern for complex conditionals

   ### Improve Naming Strategy
   #### When to Apply
   - Unclear or misleading variable/function names
   - Generic names (data, temp, info, manager)
